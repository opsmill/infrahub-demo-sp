"""Which image and tag the integration stack runs, resolved in one place.

``infrahub_testcontainers.container`` keeps its defaults in a module-level ``PROJECT_ENV_VARIABLES``
dict. That dict is consulted against ``os.environ`` when the ``.env`` file is written
(``container.py:182-183``), so an environment override does reach the deployment -- but nothing
merges the override back into the dict, so *Python-side* reads of it never see one. Reading the
image name from that dict therefore yields ``registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/infrahub`` even in a
repository that has pointed the stack at its own image, which is how a helper container ends up
running the wrong image entirely rather than merely the wrong tag.

Resolution lives here, as a pure function over an environment mapping, so it can be tested without
Docker and reused by the repositories that run custom images.

Repositories adopting this file also need to set stack knobs of their own -- typically
``INFRAHUB_TESTING_DOCKER_IMAGE``, ``INFRAHUB_TESTING_DOCKER_PULL=false`` and
``INFRAHUB_TESTING_TASKMGR_BACKGROUND_SVC_REPLICAS=1`` -- and where those assignments go matters for
exactly one variable. ``INFRAHUB_TESTING_DOCKER_IMAGE``, ``..._DOCKER_PULL`` and
``..._TASKMGR_BACKGROUND_SVC_REPLICAS`` reach the deployment whenever they are set, as long as it is
before the ``.env`` file is written, because the writer reads ``os.environ`` per key at write time.
``INFRAHUB_TESTING_WEB_CONCURRENCY`` is the exception: ``container.py:40`` interpolates it into the
``INFRAHUB_TESTING_DOCKER_ENTRYPOINT`` default while that module is being imported, so it must be
set in job-level ``env:`` or in ``tests/conftest.py``, never in a module that runs afterwards. Never
hardcode ``INFRAHUB_TESTING_DOCKER_ENTRYPOINT`` itself -- ``container.py:152-159`` rewrites it for
the enterprise edition, and hardcoding the community form pins the repository to community.

    Args:
        env: Environment mapping to read overrides from, normally ``os.environ``.
        packaged_version: Installed ``infrahub-testcontainers`` version, the last-resort tag. This
        is
            what makes a dependency bump self-validating: moving the pin moves the version under
            test, with no CI wiring at all.
        repository: Image repository this stack runs. Defaults to vanilla Infrahub, so a repository
            that says nothing gets vanilla.
        default_tag: The repository's own committed default tag, if it pins one. Most repositories
            should leave this empty: falling through to ``packaged_version`` *is* derivation from a
            committed file, since the installed version comes from the pin in ``pyproject.toml``
            resolved through ``uv.lock``, and it needs no conftest wiring at all. Only a repository
            whose stack must run a tag its dependency pin does not select should set this -- and
            then it should pass a value read from a committed file rather than a literal restated
            here, because a literal in a conftest becomes one more copy of a version that already
            lives in the Dockerfile and the compose override. A repository that runs vanilla
            Infrahub must **not** feed its ``ARG INFRAHUB_BASE_VERSION`` in here: that arg belongs
            to a demo-stack image and has nothing to do with the version under test.
        custom_build: True when this repository builds its own image. Opt-in, never inferred: the
            presence of a ``Dockerfile`` does not mean the *test stack* uses it.

    Returns:
        The resolved image.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the resolved tag is the ``"local"`` sentinel, which ``container.py:92-94``
            treats specially by re-reading ``INFRAHUB_TESTING_IMAGE_VER``. Resolving to it would
            make the returned tag and the tag the stack runs disagree, which is the class of bug
            this function exists to prevent. Also raised if ``INFRAHUB_TESTING_DOCKER_PULL`` is set
            to a value that is neither a recognised truthy nor falsy spelling -- guessing it would
            invert the caller's intent silently, the same failure mode the tag check above exists to
            prevent.
